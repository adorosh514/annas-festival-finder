# annas-festival-finder

Name of Project:
Festival Finder

Summary:
My website will provide a database of North American based music festivals categorized by music genres. It will provide features such as auth0 login for users, profiles that can be customized once the user has signed up, as well as a 5-star rating system for festivals that each user has the ability to add, edit, or delete after theyâ€™ve attended. 

* Breakdown*
10-20 genres
5-7 festivals (Canada & US only for now)

APIs & Packages Used:

Packages:

Express

Stretch Goals:
Eventually, I would like for the website to serve as a space where international events, as well as small, local events can be posted and promoted. I would also like to incorporate a feature where tickets can be scrubbed from other third party pages, so that they can be purchased either directly on my website, or redirect clients to where they can be purchased. 

I hope to create functionality that allows users to have history of past festival searches, festival ratings, past comments in addition to access to a chat forum. I would also like to have upgraded admin accounts that have power to manage the chat forum, as well as create a friends list to add and delete friends on the chat forum.
