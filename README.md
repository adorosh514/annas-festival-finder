Final Project Instructions
1. Overview and Goal
For the final project, you need to come up with an idea that is your own. This idea has to come from you, it‚Äôs YOUR project. Obviously the likelihood of something being 100% original is nearly impossible. Everything already exists in the world. That‚Äôs not what we mean by ‚Äúan idea that is your own‚Äù. We want you to create a website / web app about something you like, something that relates to you. 

The goal is to build a full-stack application from scratch that will use the technologies covered in class. That means you‚Äôll need a front-end (FE), a back-end (BE), and they‚Äôll need to communicate properly. 

The final project is your competitive edge in an interview. Make sure you build something you‚Äôre proud of! Recruiters can tell when someone is passionate and proud about the project they‚Äôve built. A generic idea won‚Äôt cut it here!

You must submit a proposal that will outline the details of your project. The proposal doesn‚Äôt need to be too long, just half a page at most. Even bullet points will do. Tell us what features it will have, what it will do, what‚Äôs the purpose, etc. Think of it as an elevator pitch! We‚Äôll review it and give you feedback on it. 
2. Requirements
In order to pass, your project must include the following:
A FE built with React.js
A BE built with Node.js
Your server must implement REST practices
Proper CRUD Operations 
A database using MongoDB
The use of an API


3. Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts
3.1 What you can do
Use of packages / libraries found on NPM or other places to help you build a cool user interface (UI) for a good user experience.
Use of external sources to help you use a resource you're not familiar with. These include:
Articles
Blog posts
Online courses
Ask your classmates for help.
Clean code (this is more for you than for us)
Organize your FE and BE nicely!
Add comments!
 Recruiters will definitely look at that. üëÄ

3.2 What is illegal
Twitter clones!
E-commerce websites!
I mean‚Ä¶ duh? Our group project is an e-commerce website you can‚Äôt just use that for your final project üòÇ
React Native
We know some of you want to build mobile applications, but we don‚Äôt teach React Native so it‚Äôs not allowed. 
Build it in React!
Mongoose
We don‚Äôt teach Mongoose.
Yes we know it‚Äôs cool.
Please stick to regular MongoDB structures.
Games
React isn‚Äôt really compatible with games.
Also the scope of games constantly increases. We want to avoid that.
Firebase
We teach MongoDB. 
No Firebase allowed! (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
Styling libraries. All your website‚Äôs styling has to come from you! You CANNOT use libraries for styling, such as:
Bootstrap.
Canvas.
Tailwind.
Literally any other! The 3 listed above are the ones people usually go for. No styling libraries allowed.
NOTE: You can use them for building UI, but not for styling.
YouTube tutorials
You CANNOT base your project on a tutorial video. That is plagiarism! 
We know they help you understand certain technologies. Just don‚Äôt copy from it!
Putting money on your project!
Don‚Äôt feel obligated to use a paid API / database for your project to run.
Paid API calls can be expensive, especially if you accidentally run an infinite loop!
If you can‚Äôt find a free API or database, it might be worth it to change ideas.
AI interactions
Building a website that sends data to an AI and then waits for a result isn‚Äôt a website. All you did was build a fetching API.
AI !== web development (believe it or not).
Hosting your project
This is NOT a requirement to pass. Don‚Äôt waste your time hosting it, you only have 2 weeks to do this! We won‚Äôt help you with this process either. 
If you want to host it, do it once you‚Äôve officially passed! There are tons of guides out there to refer to.
If you want to give it a try - Vercel for the frontend and Render for the backend




4. Tips
4.1. Users
4.1.1 Guidelines
If your website requires users, make sure there‚Äôs:
User only features / pages
Only logged in users can access the full site.
User authentication
Make sure only registered users can use your site.
User interaction 
Make sure the user can USE your website, not login for no reason.
Ex: chat system, comment system, friend system, favorites, activity, etc.
4.1.2 Recommendations
4.1.2.1 User authentication: 
Creating your own sign up / sign in methods that will check your database.
Encrypt sensitive information, like their password! Use a password hasher like Bycrypt.
Using Auth0:
You‚Äôll need to sign up to view the full documentation (and to create the authenticator).
Even if you use Auth0 to authenticate, you‚Äôll need to save the user in your database.
4.1.2.2 User interaction:
Most user interactions will require saving information in your database
Ex: comments, friends, activity.
For a chat system, try Socket.io
There are tons of tutorials on YouTube to help you set this up.
4.2 APIs
4.2.1 Guidelines
Your website needs to make use of an API, however this is contextual; if your site does not require the use of a third party API, your BE will serve as your API.
4.2.2 Recommendations
Research. No really, research! There‚Äôs A TON of APIs out there, research on Google to see if you can find one that does what you need. 

If there‚Äôs really nothing out there, and you can‚Äôt make your own because of your project‚Äôs requirements, you may need to think of another idea altogether.
4.3 Data
4.3.1 Guidelines
Your website will need data. Whether you will build up your database through user interaction, or you‚Äôll need data to already exist for your site to be functional, your site will need data. Data makes the world go round!
4.3.2 Recommendations
Plan out your data structure!
It‚Äôs vital that your structure works well with the flow of your website.
Saving data through user interaction
It‚Äôs important to save anything relevant related to the user in your database.
Dummy data
If your site requires data to exist beforehand for it to work, load up some fake data in there. Nobody said it had to be real!
Real data
If your site requires real data, fetch it from an API or a database that provides it.
REMINDER: do not pay for your data / API calls.
5. Recommended Resources
